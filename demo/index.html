        The history of video games goes as far back as the early 1950s, when academic computer scientists began designing simple
        games and simulations as part of their research. Video gaming did not reach mainstream popularity until the 1970s
        and 1980s, when video arcade games and gaming consoles using joysticks, buttons, and other controllers, along with
        graphics on computer screens and home computer games were introduced to the general public. Since the 1980s, video
        gaming has become a popular form of entertainment and a part of modern popular culture in most parts of the world.
        One of the early games was <lrndesign-vocab word="Spacewar!"></lrndesign-vocab>, which was developed by computer scientists. Early arcade video games developed
        from 1972 to 1978. During the 1970s, the first generation of home consoles emerged, including the popular game Pong
        and various "clones". The 1970s was also the era of mainframe computer games. The golden age of arcade video games
        was from 1978 to 1982. Video arcades with large, graphics-decorated coin-operated machines were common at malls and
        popular, affordable home consoles such as the Atari 2600 and Intellivision enabled people to play games on their
        home TVs. During the 1980s, gaming computers, early online gaming and handheld LCD games emerged; this era was affected
        by the video game crash of 1983. From 1976 to 1992, the second generation of video consoles emerged.
